    <p>Good times are always lost quickly. Although this course is a basic course, I have learned a lot of software applications. Among them,Illustrator, InDsign and HTML are the difficult part and they are unfamiliar to me. Through this course, I am more familiar with the basic software that graphic design must master, which plays an important role in my future career development. In fact, I want to be a graphic designer. Everything is difficult at the beginning, I believe that I have already started, I will be more successful in the future learning process. I hope everyone is fine.</p>
