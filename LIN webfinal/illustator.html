    <p>Illustrator is a very fun software. Before I took this class, I always thought it was a very difficult software. Especially the pen tool, because of the shadows of the previous learning, the shadow of the poor pen tool has been bothering me. However, through this study, I found the pen tool to be a useful and fun tool. With the pen tool, I can create graphics that can't be created by basic graphics tools, which makes me very excited.</p>
