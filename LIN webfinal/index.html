    <p>My name is Yuting Lin, a quiet girl from China. I am taking this class because of my major requirment. However, I am really interested in graphic desgin and I dream to be a graphic designer in the future. The most interesting part of the course I have learned is the Illustrator. Before taking the class, Illustrator is the hardest software for me. Nevertheless, I find it's very attractive. Espically the pen tool, an ultra useful tool,I have fallen in love with this tool. Anyway, this class is fun and I will recommend my frineds taking this class if they are interested in design.</p>
