    <p>Photoshop is a familiar but also unfamiliar software for me. The familiar part is that I have already known and learned about this software in junior high school, While the strange part is that although I learned about this software very early, it is only an entry level. I don't have a deep understanding of its operation method. Through this course, I have further consolidated the operation of this software, and I hope to learn further through advanced courses.</p>
